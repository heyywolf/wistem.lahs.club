                <p>We are currently working on a few projects that are founded and led by a few club officers and
                    members. These projects aid the fulfillment of achieving our mission through our two purposes:
                    reaching back and looking forward. The names and descriptions of these initiatives can be found

                        <p>STEMpower is a volunteer organization based in the Bay Area and works with WiSTEM, a club
                            focused on empowering students in high school to pursue STEM. Hosting a series of workshops
                            for the younger generation, elementary school students are able to gain exposure to STEM
                            through innovation and creativity. Through hands-on exploration and team projects, students
                            will have the opportunity to explore topics ranging from water density experiments to Python
                            coding.

                        <h2 class="major">STEM Speakers</h2>
                        <p>The STEM Speaker Series brings in at least one speaker per month to talk to students about
                            their career in STEM. The speakers come from all fields of STEM and can be in different
                            stages of their career to help high schoolers holistically visualize their future in STEM.

                            The goal of STEM Speakers is to present students with a role model and an example of what
                            they can achieve. Being able to personally connect with someone in their field of interest
                            provides a new perspective on STEM and can also spark a new passion. By providing these
                            opportunities to connect and converse with students and professionals in the STEM field,
                            high schoolers can visualize an exciting future in STEM.

                        <p>The goal of this program is to provide students with the guidance and support they need to
                            develop a strong, well-rounded academic and extracurricular profile while further exploring
                            their interests as they navigate throughout their 4 years of high school.

                            This mentorship program will pair college undergraduates with high school students (freshman
                            to juniors) interested in pursuing a career in STEM. Mentors will provide mentees with
                            advice ranging from how to succeed in challenging classes and build strong relationships
                            with teachers, to how to effectively communicate and seek out opportunities outside of the
                            classroom. In addition, mentor-mentee pairings provide an opportunity for participants to
                            build strong, personal relationships that extend beyond the scope of this program.
